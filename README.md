# TF2CTL â€” Team Fortress 2 Server Manager (CLI)

TF2CTL is a cross-platform CLI tool that automates provisioning and managing **TF2 game servers** in the cloud. It can spin up Linux VMs, install Docker, launch the TF2 container, upload your custom content (maps, configs, plugins), and give you a simple menu to manage and monitor servers.
This is mainly geared toward competitive play, but can be easily modified as needed.

## Highlights

* One-shot **create & configure** (no manual follow-ups)
* Works on **Windows / macOSðŸ¤ž / LinuxðŸ¤ž**
* Fully **self-contained** in your project folder
* **Bulk create** many servers (auto-names, per-server secrets)
* Built-in troubleshooting: open SSH, view logs, reapply includes
* **Safe re-runs** (idempotent setup + copy steps)

> [!WARNING]
> **Cloud costs:** Creating servers will incur charges from your cloud provider. Remember to delete servers when you're done.

## Quick Start

### 1. Requirements

* **Python 3.11+** recommended (3.13 is OK).
    Windows users can run this in powershell or cmd:
    ```powershell
    winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.11
    ```
* **Install dependencies** from the project root:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Required packages include `paramiko`, `cryptography`, and `requests`.*

### 2. Project Layout

Your project folder should be structured like this:

```plaintext
tf2ctl/
â”œâ”€ cli.py
â”œâ”€ ssh_ops.py
â”œâ”€ do_api.py
â”œâ”€ linode_api.py
â””â”€ server_resources/
   â”œâ”€ scripts/
   â”‚  â””â”€ setup.sh
   â””â”€ includes/
      â”œâ”€ cfg/      # Your configs; server.cfg will be renamed to tf2ctl.cfg
      â”œâ”€ maps/     # .bsp files
      â””â”€ addons/   # e.g. addons/sourcemod/plugins/*.smx
```

Place your custom content under `server_resources/includes/`. The tool will copy it to the correct locations on the server:

* `cfg/` â†’ is copied to `/home/tf2/server/tf/cfg/`
* `maps/` â†’ is copied to `/home/tf2/server/tf/maps/`
* `addons/` â†’ is copied to `/home/tf2/server/tf/addons/`

### 3. Run the CLI

From the project root, run this command:

```bash
python cli.py
```

### 4. Configure Provider, Token, and SSH Key

In the main menu, select "Configure provider / API token / SSH key":

1. Pick a provider (DigitalOcean or Linode).
2. Paste your provider's API token when prompted. It will be stored locally in `.tf2ctl/config.json`.
3. Generate a new Ed25519 SSH key (recommended) or supply a path to your own. Keys are stored under `.tf2ctl/`.

### 5. Create Servers

In the main menu, select "Create server(s) (auto-configure)":

1. Choose a name prefix, start number, quantity, region, server size, and starting map.
2. The tool will then:
   - Create the servers with a 1-second delay between each to be gentle on APIs.
   - Wait for public IPs to be assigned.
   - Upload `server_resources/` and run `setup.sh` on each server.
   - Copy your `includes/` content into the TF2 container.
   - Save all server credentials and connection info locally under `.tf2ctl/`.

You'll see a summary with IPs and passwords. You can also view or export connection strings at any time from the main menu.

## Uninstall / Cleanup

1. Delete all servers from the "Manage a server" or "Bulk actions" menus to avoid further cloud charges.
2. Remove the local `./tf2ctl/` directory to wipe all saved configurations, keys, logs, and server records.
